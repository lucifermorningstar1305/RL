# Reinforcement-Learning (RL) 🔮



The purpose of this branch is to serve as a storage for all the codes that I’ll be working on related to Reinforcement Learning.

I’ll also be publishing medium articles related to the concepts that I’ll be learning in this domain and the code related to those concepts can be found  in the notebooks section of this repository.



## Directory structure 📚:

* `notebooks` : Authentic concept driven notebooks related to Reinforcement Learning algorithms with proper graphs and explanation. (to be used in medium articles)
* `scripts`:  Can be experimental or dummy scripts related to Reinforcement Learning algorithms, won’t be organised, so please don’t complain. I like it that way.
